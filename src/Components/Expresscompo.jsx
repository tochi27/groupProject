          Exploring Express.js Framework
        </h1>
        <p className="text-[#08538C] mb-6">
          Express.js is a powerful and widely-used web application framework for
          Node.js. It simplifies the process of building robust and scalable web
          applications, APIs, and server-side applications. Let's delve into the
          key aspects of Express.js and how to get started with this framework.
          Express.js, commonly referred to as Express, is a minimal and flexible
          web application framework for Node.js, a popular runtime environment
          for server-side JavaScript. Express.js simplifies the process of
          building web applications and APIs by providing a set of features and
          tools that help developers manage routes, handle HTTP requests and
          responses, manage middleware, and more.
          <p>Key features of Express.js:</p>
          <p>
            Routing: Express allows you to define routes for different URLs and
            HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). This enables you to
            organize your application's functionality into manageable chunks and
            respond to specific requests with appropriate actions.<br/> Middleware:
            Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request
            and response objects in the Express application's request-response
            cycle. They can perform tasks such as authentication, logging, data
            parsing, and more. Middleware functions are executed sequentially,
            and they can modify the request and response objects or end the
            request-response cycle early.<br/> HTTP Request and Response: Express
            makes it easy to handle incoming HTTP requests and construct
            appropriate responses. You can set headers, status codes, and send
            data in various formats (HTML, JSON, etc.).<br/> Template Engines: While
            Express itself does not include a template engine, it allows you to
            integrate popular template engines like EJS, Handlebars, or Pug to
            generate dynamic HTML views.<br/> Static File Serving: You can use
            Express to serve static files such as HTML, CSS, images, and
            client-side JavaScript files.<br/> Error Handling: Express provides
            mechanisms to handle errors in a structured manner, allowing you to
            define error-handling middleware that is executed when an error
            occurs.<br/> Modularity: Express applications can be structured into
            modular components, making it easier to manage different parts of
            your application's functionality.

          Setting Up an Express Application
        </h2>
        <p className="text-[#08538C] mb-6">
          Getting started with Express.js is straightforward. You'll learn how
          to set up a basic Express application, configure routes, and handle
          HTTP requests and responses. Express provides a simple yet powerful
          API for creating endpoints and handling various HTTP methods.
          Setting up an Express application involves a few steps, including
           installing the Express package, creating the main application file, 
           and defining routes and middleware. Here's a step-by-step guide to help 
           you set up a basic Express application:<br/>
           Install Node.js and npm: Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
            installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/
        </p>
