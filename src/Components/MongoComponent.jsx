        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What is MongoDB?</h2>
        <p className="text-[#08538C]">
          MongoDB, often referred to as simply "Mongo," is a widely used open-source NoSQL database management system.
          It stores data in a flexible and schema-less format known as BSON (Binary JSON).
          MongoDB is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and is known for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Key Features and Concepts</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-[#08538C]">
          <li>Document-Oriented: Data is stored in documents similar to JSON format.</li>
          <li>Collections: Hold sets of documents.</li>
          <li>Schema Flexibility: Documents within a collection can have varying structures.</li>
          <li>CRUD Operations: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.</li>
          <li>Indexes: Improve query performance.</li>
          <li>Aggregation Framework: Perform complex data transformations.</li>
          <li>Replication and High Availability: Support for data redundancy and fault tolerance.</li>
          <li>Sharding and Scalability: Distribute data across multiple servers.</li>
          <li>Transactions: Ensure data consistency across documents.</li>
          <li>Security: Provides authentication and role-based access control.</li>
          <li>MongoDB Atlas: Managed cloud database service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Use Cases</h2>
        <p className="text-[#08538C]">
          MongoDB's flexible schema makes it well-suited for scenarios where the data model evolves over time.
          It's a popular choice for content management systems, e-commerce platforms, real-time analytics, and IoT applications.
          MongoDB's horizontal scaling capabilities also make it suitable for handling large datasets and high traffic loads.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Getting Started</h2>
        <p className="text-[#08538C]">
          To get started with MongoDB, you need to install MongoDB on your server or use a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas.
          You can interact with MongoDB using the MongoDB shell, or you can use programming languages like Node.js with libraries like Mongoose.
          Explore the official MongoDB documentation and tutorials to learn more about the various features and best practices.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Next Steps</h2>
        <p className="text-[#08538C]">
          Now that you have an overview of MongoDB's features and concepts, consider diving deeper into specific areas based on your project's requirements.
          You can explore more about MongoDB's querying capabilities, aggregation pipelines, scaling strategies, and security mechanisms.
          As you become more familiar with MongoDB, you'll be able to leverage its power to build robust and scalable applications.
